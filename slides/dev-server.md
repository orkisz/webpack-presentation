##  Webpack Dev Server

Webpack can be used to bundle your project for usage in web browser. You can use it to make a production build, but also set up the local environment with Node server. Usually it is done using webpack-dev-server.

The webpack-dev-server is a little node.js Express server, which uses the webpack-dev-middleware to serve a webpack bundle.
